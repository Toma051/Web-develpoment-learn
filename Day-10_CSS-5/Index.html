<h2>Center Align Elements:</h2>
<div class="center">
  <p>I Love Allah!</p>
</div>

<br>


<h2>Center Text:</h2>

<div class="center2">
  <p>Allah is Almighty</p>
</div>
  <h2>Center an Image:</h2>
<p>Botanically, mango is a drupe, consisting of an outer skin, a fleshy edible portion, and a central stone enclosing a single seed – also called stone fruit, like a plum, cherry or peach. Where do mangos come from? Mangos were first grown in India over 5,000 years ago. <br> Mangoes are generally sweet, although the taste and texture of the flesh vary across cultivars; some, such as Alphonso, have a soft, pulpy, juicy texture similar to an overripe plum, while others, such as Tommy Atkins, are firmer with a fibrous texture.</p>

<h2>Right align with the position property:</h2>

<p>An example of how to right align elements with the position property:</p>

<div class="right">
  <p>My parents are my strength who support me at every stage of life. I cannot imagine my life without them. My parents are like a guiding light who take me to the right path whenever I get lost. My mother is a homemaker and she is the strongest woman I know.</p>
</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Right align with the float property:</h2>

<p>An example of how to right align elements with the float property:</p>

<div class="right2">
  <p>Teacher always comes at right time in the class and never misses her class. We enjoy her class very much as she makes us happy too. Teacher loves me very much as I am her very disciplined and ideal student. I follow her all the orders and do my class work and home work in neat and clean manner daily.</p>
</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2>Without Clearfix:</h2>

<p>This image is floated to the right. It is also taller than the element containing it, so it overflows outside of its container:</p>

<div>
  <img class="img1" src="/Image/Jackfruit.png" alt="" width="170" height="170">
  Jackfruit is a tropical tree fruit grown in Asia, Africa and South America. It belongs to the same plant family as figs and mulberries. Under its thick, bumpy green rind is a stringy yellow flesh that you can eat raw or cooked in a variety of dishes.
</div>

<h2 style="clear:right">With New Modern Clearfix:</h2>
<p>Add the clearfix hack to the containing element, to fix this problem:</p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <img class="img2" src="/Image/Jackfruit.png" alt="" width="170" height="170">
  Jackfruit is a tropical tree fruit grown in Asia, Africa and South America. It belongs to the same plant family as figs and mulberries. Under its thick, bumpy green rind is a stringy yellow flesh that you can eat raw or cooked in a variety of dishes.
</div>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Center vertically with padding:</h2>

<p>In this example, we use the padding property to center the div element vertically:</p>

<div class="center3">
  <p>My sister is my guide and mentor who helps me in my studies everyday. She is very sincere and always excels in her exams at school. We are very close and discuss everything with each other. My sister is my best friend and hero and I share all my secrets with her.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2>Center with padding and text-align:</h2>

<p>In this example, we use padding and text-align to center the div element both vertically and horizontally:</p>

<div class="center4">
  <p>My younger brother is very polite by nature and is loved by one and all. He often shares his chocolates, sweets and candies with me. He loves playing snakes and ladders and ludo with me during weekends. He shares everything with me and is very comfortable discussing his classes, school friends and homework with me.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Center with line-height:</h2>

<p>In this example, we use the line-height property with a value that is equal to the height property to center the div element:</p>

<div class="center5">
  <p>As an experienced web developer, I am passionate about creating robust and user-friendly web applications. Proficient in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and framework.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Center with position and transform:</h2>

<p>In this example, we use positioning and the transform property to vertically and horizontally center the div element:</p>

<div class="center6">
  <p>Allah transcends everything but observes everything, gives provision to every creature, and knows where each one is at any moment (11:6). He encompasses everything. He is closer to people than their jugular veins (50:16). He sends revelation for their guidance and every individual will stand before Him for judgment.</p>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Flexbox Centering:</h2>

<p>A container with both the justify-content and the align-items properties set to <em>center</em> will align the item(s) in the center (in both axis).</p>

<div class="center7">
  <p>Allah, the one and only God in Islam. Etymologically, the name Allah is probably a contraction of the Arabic al-Ilāh, “the God.” The name's origin can be traced to the earliest Semitic writings in which the word for god was il, el, or eloah, the latter two used in the Hebrew Bible.</p>
